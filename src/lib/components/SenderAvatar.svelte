			Three things matter once an avatar loads.

			The plate underneath is not the hashed chip. A great many brand marks
			are transparent PNGs or SVGs, and the chip used to show through them —
			a random hue behind a logo drawn for a plain background, clashing more
			often than not. It defaults to white, which is what those marks are
			designed against, and `pickPlate` flips it dark for the minority that
			are light-on-transparent and would otherwise vanish into it.

			`object-cover`, deliberately, after trying `contain`. Plenty of
			favicons are an opaque brand square — NVIDIA's green, Substack's
			orange — and those are meant to fill the disc edge to edge, which is
			how they already looked. `contain` plus padding shrinks them into a
			rounded square floating on a circle with the corners showing: strictly
			worse for the common case, to protect a wide wordmark that favicons
			almost never are. Cover keeps opaque marks exactly as they were and
			still fixes the transparent ones, which only ever needed what is
			behind them to change.

			The hairline ring is what stops a white plate from disappearing into a
			white row in light mode — without it the disc has no edge and the mark
			just floats.
